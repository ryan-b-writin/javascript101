# javascript101- In-class exercise

View this page at: http://www.midnightthunder.net/exercises/math_exercise/index.html

This in-class exercise was meant to introduce Javascript. Students were instructed to use Javascript to determine how many seconds old they were. Students would also use an IF statement to determine whether the user is 'old' based on whether their age is greater than 32.

I added a prompt to request the user's age rather than coding it in as a static variable. I also added stats on Saturn for fun.
